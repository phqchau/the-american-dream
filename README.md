# the-american-dream
A wealth distribution model that investigates whether or not upward economic mobility is possible regardless of initial economical background.

Data about cost of living and median household income from 11 major areas in the state of Indiana were used (see Indiana data file).

The findings suggest that it is much more likely for the poor to stay poor and the rich to stay rich. Is the American Dream a lie?

Model based on the <a href="http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/WealthDistribution">Wealth Distribution</a> model in the NetLogo Models Library, by U. Wilensky.
